	Their origins trace back to nomadic desert tribes, whose survival in the harsh sands cultivated a culture steeped in resilience, cunning, and adaptability. \
	Over centuries, the Rakshari united under the banners of powerful Zybantine  merchant-kings and warlords, transforming their scattered clans into a dominant slaver force across the region., \
	For centuries, they raided weaker settlements and rival caravans, \
	capturing slaves to fuel their expanding cities and economies, \
	practice of this was justified through religious doctrines venerating strength and dominance as divine virtues \
	As they attached themselves to Zybantine Rakshari integrated more sophisticated forms of servitude, including indentured contracts and debt bondage. \

	THIS IS A DISCRIMINATED SPECIES. EXPECT A MORE DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\
